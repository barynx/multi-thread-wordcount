From what I know and researched, the synchronized keyword in Java lets synchronize 
a method or code block statement to handle multi-threaded access. If I want to lock
 a file for writing purposes on a multi-threaded environment, I must should use the 
classes in the Java NIO package to get the best results. Yesterday, I come up with 
a question about handling a shared servlet for file I/O operations, and BalusC 
comments are good to help with the solution, but the code in this answer confuses me. 
I'm not asking community "burn that post" or "let's downvote him" (note: I haven't 
downvoted it or anything, and I have nothing against the answer), I'm asking for an 
xplanation if the code fragment can be considered a good practice
